This Fire Escape Route Solver GUI requires Python 3.7 or later.

The program creates a file based on the user's input and performs a system call to Clingo.

The output file is named fireout.txt and is parsed using MKAtoms, and is read back to the GUI.

This program requires Clingo and MKAtoms to be installed in the user's system path in order to perform the system call.
